# WorldCupData
Using data to figure out trends in the World Cup from the past 80+ years

Grabbing data from Kaggle, I will use Seaborn to create a series of plots, discover aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games from 1930 to 2014. I want to show the average number of goals for each World Cup so we can see some sort of upwards or downwards trend of goals scored.  And as mentioned earlier to go along with the average goals is the distribution of goals for each World Cup
